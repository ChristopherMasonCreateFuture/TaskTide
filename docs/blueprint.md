## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) to create a focused yet calm ambiance. Mimicking the organizational aspect of the app. This dark shade will allow for great legibility when coupled with the right background
- Background color: Very light lavender grey (#F7F5FA) to complement the primary and provide a neutral base.
- Accent color: Sky Blue (#7DD3FC) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body text due to its versatility and neutral, modern appearance.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for actions and status indicators. Example: Checkmark for completed task, pen for editing
- Follow a clean, card-based layout to organize tasks. Use consistent spacing and alignment.
- Add subtle transitions for task completion and deletion to enhance user feedback.
